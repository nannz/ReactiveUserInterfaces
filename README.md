Installing create-react-app

Perform these steps to install create-react-app on your computer:

First make sure that you are running the latest version of Node.js.
Run npm install -g create-react-app from your terminal. If you're getting an error, try running sudo npm install -g create-react-app.

Creating a new app

Perform these steps to generate a new React app inside of your class repository.


Move into your class folder by running cd PATH in your terminal. 
You need to replace PATH with the actual name of your folder. If it is in Documents, this would be cd ~/Documents/reactive-user-interfaces.
Run create-react-app PROJECTNAME where you replace PROJECTNAME with the name of your project. For a simple test project, you can run create-react-app test.
Now follow the instructions provided by the generator. You will need to cd into the new folder and run npm start to see the app in your browser.
