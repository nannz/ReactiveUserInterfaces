Installing create-react-app

Perform these steps to install create-react-app on your computer:

First make sure that you are running the latest version of Node.js.
Run npm install -g create-react-app from your terminal. If you're getting an error, try running sudo npm install -g create-react-app.

Creating a new app

Perform these steps to generate a new React app inside of your class repository.


Move into your class folder by running cd PATH in your terminal. 
You need to replace PATH with the actual name of your folder. If it is in Documents, this would be cd ~/Documents/reactive-user-interfaces.
Run create-react-app PROJECTNAME where you replace PROJECTNAME with the name of your project. For a simple test project, you can run create-react-app test.
Now follow the instructions provided by the generator. You will need to cd into the new folder and run npm start to see the app in your browser.

after create the react app, the commands that I can use:
 npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd w2c1_react_form_example
  npm start
