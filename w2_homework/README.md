Assignment for Monday
For next week, you will re-create the following article listing from nytimes.com.

The nytimes.com UI that we will build

A few hints:

You can use Georgia as the typeface for both headings and paragraphs
You need to use CSS flexbox for positioning elements horizontally next to each other. I have created an example to demonstrate this. Also, This article on flexbox is good, and so is this reference. If you are stuck, please ask for help.
You can use whatever images you want.
The listing needs to use the same React component three times.
Please post a screenshot of your app with a short description on the documentation blog + a link to your code on GitHub.
